Capstone projects are solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections. It is a real-world-like project built with business specifications This project was at the end of the Ruby on Rails curriculum section. For this project, I created an app that allows you to register books that you have read and group them into groups of your choosing. These groups can be either book genres or groups based on bookclubs. You are free to choose how you want to group your books. It also allows you to view books that other users of the app are using but not their personal thoughts on the project. As an extra feature, I decided to implement a search page where you can get information about a particular book via the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com">GoodReads </a>website.
